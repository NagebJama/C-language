  //Here we shall learn variables.
  //What is a variable?
  //A variable is just a way to give a name to a place in your computer's memory where you store data.
  //For xample :
  int age=0; // 'age' is the name of the variable
  printf("The age of child is : %d\n",age);

  //creating a variable is done in two steps:
    /* 1.declaration
       2.initialization

    */

   int x; //declartion
   x=50; //initialization
   char grade= 'A';
   char name[]=  "Najib Jama"; //an array of characters.

  printf("Hello %s\n",name);
  printf("Your average grade is : %c",grade);
